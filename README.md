# gamestate-gmod

Garry's Mod addon counterpart for the [gamestate npm package](https://github.com/06000208/gamestate)

If your node.js project using gamestate is accessed with a local ip (for example, 192.168.x.x) you must launch the dedicated server running this addon with the `-allowlocalhttp` parameter
